			<h1>Internship task A: Roll the dice</h1>
			<p>For our new RPG game, we will need to generate random numbers by rolling N-sided dice. A standard 6 sided die should randomly produce numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 20 sided die should produce random results from 1 to 20.</p>
			<p>BONUS TASK: In addition, sometimes we want the player to roll with advantage or disadvantage. Advantage means we roll two times and return the higher result of the two. Disadvantage means we roll two times and return the lower result of the two.</p>
			<h2>Inputs</h2>
			<p>1) A number of sides of a die</p>
			<p>2) An optional type of roll: "advantage" | "disadvantage" | undefined (a single roll)</p>

			<h2>Output</h2>
			<p>A random number between 1 and the number of sides included with equal chance for each number. A higher number of two rolls in case of "advantage" or lower number of two rolls in case of "disadvantage".</p>

			<h2>Sample input</h2>
			<p>4</p>

			<h2>Sample outputs when ran 10 times</h2>
			<p>4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3</p>
			<p>Explanation: Random numbers between 1 and 4</p>

			<h2>BONUS TASK: Sample input with advantage</h2>
			<p>4, "advantage"</p>
			<p>Explanation: Roll twice random numbers between 1 and 4 and take the higher result</p>

			<h2>BONUS TASK: Sample input with disadvantage</h2>
			<p>4, "disadvantage"</p>
			<p>Explanation: Roll twice random numbers between 1 and 4 and take the lower result</p>
