# Internship task A: Roll the dice

For our new RPG game, we will need to generate random numbers by rolling N-sided dice. A standard 6 sided die should randomly produce numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 20 sided die should produce random results from 1 to 20.

## BONUS TASK: 
In addition, sometimes we want the player to roll with advantage or disadvantage. Advantage means we roll two times and return the higher result of the two. Disadvantage means we roll two times and return the lower result of the two.
